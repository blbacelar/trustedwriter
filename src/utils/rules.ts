Hey there, we're the Bacelar Family—an adventurous bunch with a deep love for animals! Our lives have been sprinkled with furry friends since childhood. From my husband's cherished dog, cat, and bunny to my own dog-filled days and magical moments on my grandparents' farm, animals have always been a part of us.

Our journey has been a whirlwind, taking us from the vast landscapes of Canada (where we spent some incredible years), to the lush beauty of Brazil, and the captivating vibes of Portugal. And now, we're on a temporary stop in the enchanting UK.

Through all these travels, our daughters Emilie (5) and Chloe (3) have discovered the wonders of nature and the magic of bonding with animals. Seeing how much this means to them, we've chosen a unique way to keep the magic alive—house sitting. This lets us explore new places while giving your pets the love and care they deserve, right at home.

With a lifetime of animal companionship and a serious case of wanderlust, we're committed to treating your home and furry friends like our own. This journey blends our love for animals and our craving for adventure.

We can't wait to get to know you, your adorable pets, and the soul of your home. Let's weave some amazing stories together, one paw at a time!
